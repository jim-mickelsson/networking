## Project Overview
This repository documents my ongoing study of enterprise network architecture. Over the coming weeks, I will be building a multi-site network simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer, moving from basic switching to advanced security.

## Project Roadmap
I am following an iterative approach to simulate real-world network growth.

### Completed Milestones
- [x] **Phase 1: The Foundation**
  - [x] VLAN Segmentation & Trunks
  - [x] Router-on-a-Stick (Inter-VLAN Routing)
  - [x] DHCP Services

- [x] **Phase 2: WAN Expansion**
  - [x] OSPF Implementation (Single Area)
  - [x] Branch Office Connectivity (Serial WAN)
  - [x] Remote Site VLAN Segmentation

- [x] **Phase 3: Internet Edge**
  - [x] ISP Simulation & Public Services
  - [x] NAT Overload (PAT) Implementation
  - [x] Default Route Propagation

### Upcoming
- [ ] **Phase 4: Security Hardening**
  - [ ] Device Hardening (SSH, User Accounts, Banners)
  - [ ] Layer 2 Security (Port Security, BPDU Guard)
  - [ ] Layer 3 Security (Extended ACLs)

## Technologies Practiced
* **Switching:** VLANs, 802.1Q, STP
* **Routing:** OSPF, Static Routes, NAT/PAT
* **Security:** ACLs, Port Security, SSH

## Learning Resources & Methodology

### Academic Coursework

* **Network Technology (Nätverksteknik):** Core module of the *IT Security Engineer* program at Yrkeshögskolan i Enköping.
  * *Key concepts applied:* Subnetting, TCP/IP stack behavior, Routing & Switching configuration, Network Segmentation (LAN/WAN), VPN/Firewall implementation, and System Hardening.

* **GeeksforGeeks:** Utilized as a primary theoretical reference to deepen my understanding of network fundamentals.

* **AI Assistance (Gemini):** Used as a "Virtual Senior Engineer" to validate architectural decisions and streamline workflow.
  * *Key contributions:* Troubleshooting configuration errors, refining industry-standard best practices, and structuring professional documentation.
