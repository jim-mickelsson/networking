## About This Repository
This repository serves as a centralized portfolio for my ongoing technical development in Network Engineering and IT Security. It contains distinct projects ranging from enterprise network simulations to security hardening and automation scripts.

My goal is to document my journey from fundamental concepts to advanced architectural implementation, integrating knowledge from my formal education (Yrkeshögskolan) and self-directed study.
