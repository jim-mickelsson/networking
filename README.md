# Enterprise Network Evolution Project
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Planning_Phase-yellow)

## Project Overview
This repository documents my ongoing study of enterprise network architecture. Over the coming weeks, I will be building a multi-site network simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer, moving from basic switching to advanced security.

## Project Roadmap
I am following an iterative approach to simulate real-world network growth.

- [x] **Phase 1: The Foundation**
  - [ ] VLAN Segmentation & Trunks
  - [ ] Router-on-a-Stick
  - [ ] DHCP Services
  
- [ ] **Phase 2: WAN Expansion**
  - [ ] OSPF Implementation
  - [ ] Branch Office Connectivity
  
- [ ] **Phase 3: Security & Optimization**
  - [ ] NAT/PAT
  - [ ] ACL Configuration
  - [ ] EtherChannel Redundancy

## Technologies to be Practiced
* **Switching:** VLANs, 802.1Q, STP
* **Routing:** OSPF, Static Routes
* **Security:** ACLs, Port Security
